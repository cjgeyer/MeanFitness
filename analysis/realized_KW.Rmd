# Abstract
This work builds on @kulbaba-et-al and @zenodo to obtain estimates of the realized response to natural selection.

@kulbaba-et-al and the correction to it [@zenodo]
presented estimates of mean fitness and additive genetic variance for fitness
we obtained for three populations of *Chamaecrista fasciculata*,
each grown in its home location in three years via aster analyses of records of components of fitness for a pedigreed set of individuals.
Here, we consider the realized change in mean fitness from one generation to the next, for comparison with the prediction from Fisher's
Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection.
As a guide, we have the document `mf.pdf` (in the same git repository as
this document), which develops a partitioning of the
overall change in mean fitness, showing a portion of the change that is due to change in genetic composition
(i.e. representation of the paternal families) and a portion that is due to difference in environmental conditions between years.
The genetic portion is then further partitioned into the part "due to natural
selection", which is described by Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, and the remainder.
Here, we obtain estimates of a) mean fitness of the pedigreed parental populations before selection (previously presented in @kulbaba-et-al and the
Correction); b) mean fitness of the pedigreed parental population after selection (i.e. accounting for the change in representation of the families
reflected in differential seed production); and mean fitness of the offspring of the pedigreed sets
(i.e. the outcome of natural selestion on the parental
generation when grown in the same sites in the following year).

We also obtain standard errors of our estimates.

# Data

For the analyses in @kulbaba-et-al and @zenodo the data files are
```
GCdat.csv
KWdat.csv
csdat.csv
```
for 

 * Grey Cloud Dunes Scientific and Natural Area

 * Kellogg-Weaver Dunes, also called McCarthy Lake, and

 * Conard Environmental Research Area (CERA),

respectively.  For more details @kulbaba-et-al.

These data files were downloaded from the GitHub repository
https://github.com/mason-kulbaba/adaptive-capacity which
contains the code and data for the analysis of the original paper.
So we are using the same data but doing a different analysis.

For this document the data files are
```
KWdat.csv
KW_2015_planting_data.csv
```
The former is the same data used by @kulbaba-et-al and @zenodo
and the latter contains pedigree information we need to match up
offspring with parents and grandparents.

# Introduction

We do aster (@aster2, @reaster) analyses for an aster model with graph
$$
\begin{CD}
  1 @>\text{Ber}>> \texttt{Germ}
  @>\text{Ber}>> \texttt{flw}
  @>\text{Poi}>> \texttt{total.pods}
  @>\text{samp}>> \texttt{total.pods.collected}
  @>\text{Poi}>> \texttt{totalseeds}
\end{CD}
$$
where the variables are

 * `Germ` is germination indicator (0 = no, 1 = yes), conditionally Bernoulli.

 * `flw` is survival to flowering (0 = no, 1 = yes),
    conditionally Bernoulli.

 * `total.pods` is total number of pods produced,
   conditionally Poisson.

 * `total.pods.collected` is number of pods collected,
   conditionally Bernoulli (i.e. each pod may be collected or not).  The arrow leading to this node
   is a subsampling arrow.  The number of pods collected is
   a random sample of the pods produced.

 * `totalseeds` is total number of seeds counted from collected pods,
   conditionally Poisson.

As always with aster models, the name of the distribution for an arrow
is the name of the conditional distribution of the successor variable
given the predecessor variable.

Set graphical model description in R.
```{r graph}
vars <- c("Germ", "flw", "total.pods", "total.pods.collected", "totalseeds")
pred <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
fam <- c(1, 1, 2, 1, 2)
```

# Example Analysis

## Determine Data to Analyze

We start by doing one example, but we do it in such a way that code
can be reused for all analyses.  The following two variables determine
(entirely) the analysis to be done.
```{r mydata.myyear}
mydata <- "KWdat.csv"
myyear <- 2015
```
We also need to specify the year of the corresponding set of offspring.

```{r myyearf}
myyearf <- myyear + 1
```

## Read Data

Read in data.
```{r read}
dat <- read.csv(mydata)
#badname <- "G2YR2"
#rename_cohort <- with(dat, cohort == badname)
#head(rename_cohort)
#dat[rename_cohort, "cohort"] <- "field"
```

## Remove Maternal ID Zero

Parental ID Zero is "unknown" and hence should be removed
from these analyses.
```{r remove}
#zeros <- dat$paternalID == 0 | dat$maternalID == 0
zeros <- dat$maternalID == 0
dat <- dat[! zeros, ]
```

## Make Factor Variables

Show types of variables.
```{r types}
sapply(dat, class)
```
Some of these variables need to be `factor`.
```{r factor}
dat <- transform(dat,
    maternalID = as.factor(maternalID),
    paternalID = as.factor(paternalID),
    block = as.factor(block))
```

## Fix Data

Check subsampling is correct, i.e. that the number of pods sampled from a given plant is not greater than the total number of pods it was recorded to
have produced.
```{r oopsie}
oopsie <- with(dat, total.pods.collected > total.pods)
```
The following should say `FALSE`.
```{r oopsie.show}
any(oopsie)
```

For this example, there is a problem to fix.
```{r subsamp.too}
if (any(oopsie))
    dat[oopsie, ]
```

So this data error has to be corrected: we assume
`total.pods` is correct and equal to `total.pods.collected`
for these rows of the data.
```{r subsamp.fix}
if (any(oopsie))
    dat[oopsie, "total.pods.collected"] <- dat[oopsie, "total.pods"]
```

## Subset Data for pedigreed cohort

Subset the data to get one part we want to analyze separately.
Other parts are analyzed in the same way.
Divide into year-specific files.
```{r data.too}
subdat <- subset(dat, year == myyear & cohort == "greenhouse")
with(subdat, length(unique(paternalID)))
```
## Remove Paternal ID Zero

Parental ID Zero is "unknown" and hence should be removed
from these analyses.
```{r remove2}
zeros <- subdat$paternalID == 0 
subdat <- subdat[! zeros, ]
```


Show that we did the subset correctly.
```{r data.too.show}
unique(subdat$year)
```

## Subset Data for offspring cohort (field)

Now for offspring data.
Subset the data to get one part we want to analyze separately.
Other parts are analyzed in the same way.
Divide into year-specific files.
```{r dataf.too}
subdatfield <- subset(dat, year == myyearf & cohort == "field")
```

Show that we did the subset correctly.
```{r dataf.too.show}
unique(subdatfield$year)
```
Drop unused levels.
```{r data.too.too}
subdat <- droplevels(subdat)
subdatfield <- droplevels(subdatfield)
```
## Find Grandfathers

Now we have to look up grandfathers of the offspring generation.
To do this we have to look up data in another file
and use R function `match`.
```{r findGDs2016}
plantingdat2015 <- read.csv("KW_2015_planting_data.csv")
names(plantingdat2015)
idx <- match(subdatfield$position, plantingdat2015$position)
length(idx)
head(idx)
```
Every plant is in a certain row and position within row.
We combine these into one key.
```{r findGDs2016.too}
pos_row <- with(subdatfield, paste(position,row,sep="_"))
head(pos_row)
pos_row_planting2015 <- with(plantingdat2015, paste(position,row,sep="_"))
idx <- match(pos_row, pos_row_planting2015)
```
Now R vector `idx` tells us which individuals in R data frame `subdatfield`
correspond to which individuals in R dataframe `plantingdat2015`, that is,
```{r findGDs2016.too.show}
identical(pos_row, pos_row_planting2015[idx])
```
The fact that there are no `NA` values in `idx` means every individual in
data frame `subdatfield` has been found in dataframe `plantingdat2015`.
```{r findGDs2016.too.show.too}
all(! is.na(idx))
```

Now we do the find the dams of these individuals.

```{r findGDs2016.too.too}
matloc <- with(plantingdat2015,
    paste(maternalposition[idx], maternalrow[idx], sep="_"))
matlocsubdat <- with(subdat, paste(position, row, sep="_"))
idx2 <- match(matloc, matlocsubdat)
all(! is.na(idx2))
length(idx2) == nrow(subdatfield)
```
So now `idx2` gives the index in `subdat` of the mother of the individual
in the corresponding position in `subdatfield`.  So the following adds
a maternal grandfather variable to R data frame `subdatfield`.
```{r findGDs2016.too.too.too}
subdatfield <- transform(subdatfield, grandfather=subdat$paternalID[idx2])

names(subdatfield)
head(subdatfield)
with(subdatfield, length(unique(grandfather)))
```

## Reshape Data

Reshape data the way R function `aster` wants it.
```{r reshape}
redata <- reshape(subdat, varying = list(vars), direction = "long",
    timevar = "varb", times = as.factor(vars), v.names = "resp")
redataf <- reshape(subdatfield, varying = list(vars), direction = "long",
    timevar = "varb", times = as.factor(vars), v.names = "resp")
```

Add indicator variable `fit` to indicate "fitness" nodes (in these data
just one node).  Also add `root` (in these data always equal to 1).
```{r fit}
redata <- transform(redata,
    fit = as.numeric(grepl("totalseeds", as.character(varb))),
    root = 1)
redataf <- transform(redataf,
    fit = as.numeric(grepl("totalseeds", as.character(varb))),
    root = 1)
```

## Random Effect Aster Model

In our preliminary analyses of the pedigreed cohort, produced by hand-pollinations in the greenhouse, we modeled sire and dam effects separately and found their components of variance to be comparable in magnitude. This is
evidence that there are negligible contributions of dominance and maternal effects to resemblance of sibs. It is thus valid to estimate a single common
variance for the nuclear genetic contributions of sires and of dams to offspring fitness. 
In order to have the same variance for the random effects for sires and dams we do the following.
```{r random.effect}
modmat.sire <- model.matrix(~ 0 + fit:paternalID, redata)
modmat.dam <- model.matrix(~ 0 + fit:maternalID, redata)
head(colnames(modmat.sire))
head(colnames(modmat.dam))
modmat.siredam <- cbind(modmat.sire, modmat.dam)
```

```{r key.gc, echo=FALSE}
key <- tools::md5sum(mydata)
```
Then we can fit the model.
```{r random.effect.too, cache=TRUE, cache.extra=key}
rout <- reaster(resp ~ fit + varb,
    list(parental=~0 + modmat.siredam, block = ~ 0 + fit:block),
    pred, fam, varb, id, root, data = redata)
```
And show the results.
```{r random.effect.show, cache=TRUE, dependson="random.effect.too"}
summary(rout)
with(rout, length(grep("paternal", names(b))))
```

```{r debug.b}
my.b <- with(rout, b[grep("paternal", names(b))])
```

## Random Effect Aster Model for offspring generation ('field')

The offspring generation arose via open pollination of the pedigreed generation. 
For this reason, we do not know paternity of individuals in this generation. We focus on 
mean fitnesses for families descending from individual sires in the set of crosses that produced the pedigreed generation. 
For interest's sake, we also carry out random effects analysis 
with maternal plant in the pedigreed generation as the random factor.


```{r random.effect.field, cache=TRUE}
#modmat.sire <- model.matrix(~ 0 + fit:paternalID, redata)
modmat.dam <- model.matrix(~ 0 + fit:maternalID, redataf)
modmat.grandfather <- model.matrix(~ 0 + fit:grandfather, redataf)
#head(colnames(modmat.sire))
#head(colnames(modmat.dam))
head(colnames(modmat.grandfather))
dim(modmat.grandfather)
```

```{r key.gcfield, echo=FALSE}
key <- tools::md5sum(mydata)
```
Then we can fit the model.
```{r checkerrors, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# make (after this) all code chunks have option error=TRUE
# currently turned off
# change eval=FALSE to eval=TRUE (the default) to have this effect
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=TRUE)
```

```{r random.effect.field.too, cache=TRUE, cache.extra=key}
routf.mom <- reaster(resp ~ fit + varb,
list(parental=~0 + modmat.dam, block = ~ 0 + fit:block),
pred, fam, varb, id, root, data = redataf)
routf.granddad <- reaster(resp ~ fit + varb,
    list(parental=~0 + modmat.grandfather, block = ~ 0 + fit:block),
    pred, fam, varb, id, root, data = redataf)
dim(modmat.grandfather)
dim(redataf)
```
In the following, we check to make sure that the families represented in the pedigreed generation ('greenhouse') include all the families (i.e. sires
in the original crosses) in the offspring generation.

```{r debug.bf}
my.bf <- with(routf.granddad, b[grep("grandfather", names(b))])
all.equal(names(my.b), names(my.bf), check.attributes = FALSE)
head(names(my.b))
head(names(my.bf))
idx.b <- sub("^.*paternalID", "", names(my.b))
idx.bf <- sub("^.*grandfather", "", names(my.bf))
head(idx.b)
head(idx.bf)
setequal(idx.b, idx.bf)
```
Now we show the results for the offspring cohort.

```{r random.effect.field.show, cache=TRUE, dependson="random.effect.field.too"}
summary(routf.mom)
summary(routf.granddad)
bf <- routf.granddad$b
bf <- bf[grep("grandfather", names(bf))]
length(bf)
```

# Function to Map from Canonical to Mean Value Parameter

As with generalized linear models, aster models are linear on
a scale (the canonical parameter scale) that is a nonlinear transformation from the scale of biological measurement.
To complete our analysis, we convert our estimates from the canonical parameter scale
back to the measurement scale (the mean value parameter scale).
We use the map factory concept (use a function to make another function).
This provides many benefits over defining the function we want directly.
It allows us to embed information in the function we make with the factory.
It allows us to easily remake the function whenever we need it.
And the latter is important, because the map from the canonical parameter
scale to the mean value parameter scale depends on the data we have fit.
In particular, and in contrast to standard linear models, estimates of
variance components here depend on the fixed effects.
```{r factory, cache=TRUE}
map.factory <- function(rout, is.subsamp) {
    stopifnot(inherits(rout, "reaster"))
    stopifnot(is.logical(is.subsamp))
    aout <- rout$obj
    stopifnot(inherits(aout, "aster"))
    nnode <- ncol(aout$x)
    if(nnode != length(is.subsamp))
        stop("length(is.subsamp) not the number of nodes in the aster graph")
    alpha <- rout$alpha
    ifit <- which(names(alpha) == "fit")
    if (length(ifit) != 1)
        stop("no fixed effect named fit")
    # return map function
    function (b) {
        stopifnot(is.numeric(b))
        stopifnot(is.finite(b))
        stopifnot(length(b) == 1)
        alpha[ifit] <- alpha[ifit] + b
        xi <- predict(aout, newcoef = alpha,
            model.type = "conditional", is.always.parameter = TRUE)
        xi <- matrix(xi, ncol = nnode)
        # always use drop = FALSE unless you are sure you don't want that
        # here if we omit drop = FALSE and there is only one non-subsampling
        # node, the code will break (apply will give an error)
        xi <- xi[ , ! is.subsamp, drop = FALSE]
        mu <- apply(xi, 1, prod)
        # mu is unconditional mean values for model without subsampling
        # in this application all components mu are the same because no
        # covariates except varb, so just return only one
        mu[1]
    }
}
```
Here R function `map.factory` when invoked returns a function that maps
from a possible value of a parental effect on the canonical parameter scale
(what the model has) to the corresponding value on the mean value parameter
scale.  This depends on the model and the fixed effect parameters,
which are taken from argument `rout`, and it corrects for subsampling,
which is indicated by the argument `is.subsamp`.
The specific line of code that corrects for subsampling is
```
xi <- xi[ , ! is.subsamp, drop = FALSE]
```
This makes the result a function of conditional means of non-subsampling
arrows only.

Note that we are ignoring blocks.  This is the same as setting the block
effect to zero.  This is not the actual effect of any actual block. Rather, it
is something like the population mean of the population of blocks. 
Specifically, we are setting the block effect to be the mean of the
distribution that the model says block effects have (mean zero normal).
We acknowledge that the blocks are not a simple random sample
of some population of blocks, but this is not necessary for a random
effects model to be appropriate.  We are using a model with block as a
random effect merely to simplify interpretation: otherwise we would have different
estimates for each block. The use of the correction for subsampling does not
depend on the decision of whether to treat blocks as fixed or random.

Except for this fit, the variance of block effects is estimated to be zero,
which means all of the block effects are equal, and they have mean zero by
the model assumptions, so all block effects are estimated to be zero in
this fit.  So *for this fit only* we are using the fitted block effects
(zero) for all blocks.  Of course, as everywhere else in statistics, estimates
are not the parameters they estimate.  So all block effects estimated to be
zero is not the same as all true unknown block effects equal to zero.

**Caution:** this function does not handle the case where more than one node
of the graph contributes to `fit` nor does it check.  It assumes we have
a linear graph, which we do.
```{r check.linear}
identical(pred, seq(along = pred) - 1)
```
If we did not have a linear graph, then correction for subsampling would
be much more complicated.  There is an appendix about this in the
supplementary material for @zenodo.

Invoke the function to construct an R function `map` that maps from
canonical to mean value parameter values for these data.
Also vectorize this function, which is useful in certain contexts.
```{r map, cache=TRUE}
map <- map.factory(rout, vars == "total.pods.collected")

mapv <- Vectorize(map)
```

Also for the field cohort analysis: Invoke the function to construct an R function `mapf` that maps from
canonical to mean value parameter values for these data.
Also vectorize this function, which is useful in certain contexts.
(Notice how having a map factory comes in handy here.)

```{r mapfv, cache=TRUE}
mapf <- map.factory(routf.granddad, vars == "total.pods.collected")

mapfv <- Vectorize(mapf)
```

<!--
Apparently if there are any special characters in the label, the figure
tag gets wrongly printed.  So use camelCase for labels of figure chunks.
-->
Plot this function.


```{r mapGraph,fig.align="center",fig.cap="Map from parental random effect on the canonical parameter scale to the mean value parameter scale."}
sigma.hat <- rout$sigma["parental"]
curve(mapv, from = -3 * sigma.hat, to = 3 * sigma.hat, log = "y")
```
Plot this function also for offspring cohort.
```{r mapfGraph,fig.align="center",fig.cap="Map from parental random effect on the canonical parameter scale to the mean value parameter scale."}
sigma.hat <- routf.granddad$sigma["parental"]
curve(mapfv, from = -3 * sigma.hat, to = 3 * sigma.hat, log = "y")
```

We digress to note that this map indicates a very large range of fitness
on the mean value parameter scale (Fig. \@ref(fig:mapGraph)). This may seem
surprising, but it results from the nonlinearity of the relationship between
the canonical parameter scale and the mean value parameter scale and 
follows the conventional logic of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM)
[@stiratelli-laird-ware] or aster models with random effects [@reaster].
Admittedly, three standard deviations is a fairly extreme value for a normal
random variable (happens with probability `r 2 * pnorm(-3)`).  Similar issues affect
all GLMM and aster models with random effects.

# Breeding Value Estimates

R function `reaster` provides estimates of the "breeding values"
(in scare quotes, because these are not the "breeding values" of conventional
quantitative genetics) on the
canonical parameter scale.  Of course, these are not precisely estimates,
because breeding values are random effects rather than unknown parameters.
So they are more analogous to BLUPS (best linear unbiased predictors)
of breeding values in conventional
quantitative genetics.  Except they are not really that either due to the
nonlinearity of the mapping from canonical to mean values shown above.

The document `mf.pdf` referred to above says they are BLUP with the B, L,
and U.  Only the P remains because anything we use as a prediction is a
prediction.  But it also what they actually are.  BLUP are conditional
expectations of breeding values for a quantitative trait (here fitness)
given observed values.  But conventional quantititative genetics assumes
observed trait values and breeding values are jointly multivariate normal,
hence the conditional distribution of breeding values given observed trait
values is also multivariate normal, hence linear in the observed trait values
(that is the L in BLUP), symmetric about the mean (as any normal distribution
is), hence unbiased (that is the U in BLUP).  But the symmetry and unimodality
of normal
distributions means that mean, median, and mode are the same (all equal to
the center of symmetry).
So we can think of BLUP as conditional means, conditional medians,
or conditional modes.  Means do not go through nonlinear transformations,
but medians and modes do go through monotone nonlinear transformations,
which mappings from canonical parameter scale to mean value parameter scale
in exponential family models (including aster models) are.
So we can say what we are doing are CMP for
conditional median (or mode) predictors.  And these generalize BLUP because
BLUP are also CMP.

Regardless, we map these quantities to the mean value parameter scale.
We do this just for breeding values of sires (in 'greenhouse' cohort). 
These are same individuals called 'grandfathers' in the 'field' cohort. We also obtain the 
random effect estimates for them, based on the field cohort.
```{r sire.breeding}
b <- rout$b
head(names(b))
idx <- grep("paternal", names(b))
b <- b[idx]
length(b)
```

```{r grandsire.effects}
bf <- routf.granddad$b
head(names(bf))
idx <- grep("grandfather", names(bf))
bf <- bf[idx]

length(bf)
```

Fix up names so not so verbose.
```{r fixnames}
names(b) <- sub("modmat.siredamfit:paternalID", "", names(b))
```
```{r fixnamesf}
names(bf) <- sub("modmat.grandfatherfit:grandfather", "", names(bf))
```

```{r debug}
all.equal(b, bf)
all.equal(my.b, b, check.attributes = FALSE)
all.equal(my.bf, bf, check.attributes = FALSE)
```
**Query from Charlie.**
Not sure what is going on here.  Are `b` and `bf` even supposed to be equal?
If not, why are we checking?  Is this just something that should be commented
out?

# Obtain realized genetically based change in mean fitness within parental generation
We now compute the expressions in mf2 to partition the change in mean fitness between generations
into components of interest. There are 5 bulleted expressions. The first is the genetic change in
mean fitness of the parental ('greenhouse') generation in the envt in which selection took place.

```{r genprevdeltaW, cache=TRUE}
mu <- mapv(b)
length(mu)

popmeanbefore <- mean(mu)

popmeanbefore

q <- mu/sum(mu)
if(myyear == 2016) q16 <-q
length(q)

f_Specific_effects <- cbind(mu, q)
f_Specific_effects

sum(q*mu)
freqchange <- q - 1/length(b)

fammeanchange <- freqchange * mu

genprevWchange <- sum(fammeanchange)
genprevWchange

```

```{r deltaWtotal, cache=TRUE}
muf <- mapfv(bf)
length(muf)
length(q)

origgranddads <- sub("^.*ID","", names(my.b))
origgranddads
fgranddads <- sub("^.*grandfather","", names(bf))
fgranddads

idx <- match(fgranddads,origgranddads)
idx
any(!is.na(idx))

idx

q[idx]
muf

offspringmeanW <- sum(q[idx]*muf)
offspringmeanW 

totalWchange <- offspringmeanW - popmeanbefore
totalWchange
```

# Fit Models for the other cohorts of the Same set of crosses

The first thing we need to do is save our model fit so we do not clobber
it with a new model fit.  First make an empty list.
```{r fit.save.zero, cache=TRUE}
save.rout <- list()
save.pedigreedmean <- list()
save.routf <- list()
save.offspring <- list()
```
Then save the fit we have.
```{r fit.save.one, cache=TRUE, dependson="random.effect.too"}
site.name <- substr(mydata, 1, 2)
site.name
fit.name <- paste0(site.name, myyear)
fit.name
save.rout[[fit.name]] <- rout
```

```{r fit.save.more, cache=TRUE, dependson="random.effect.too"}
save.pedigreedmean[[fit.name]] <- popmeanbefore
```

Also for offspring
```{r offspringmeanW.save, cache=TRUE, dependson="random.effect.field.too"}
site.name <- substr(mydata, 1, 2)
site.name
fit.name <- paste0(site.name, myyearf)
fit.name
save.routf[[fit.name]] <- routf.granddad
save.offspring[[fit.name]] <- offspringmeanW
```

Now we need to put stuff done above in a loop.  In the chunk below, we reuse
multiple code chunks above (this is not visible in the PDF output, you must
look at the Rmd source file).
```{r fit.some.more, cache=TRUE, cache.extra=key, error=TRUE}
for (myyear in 2016:2017) {
<<data.too>>
<<data.too.too>>
<<reshape>>
<<fit>>
<<random.effect>>
<<random.effect.too>>
<<factory>>
<<map>>
<<sire.breeding>>
<<genprevdeltaW>>
<<fit.save.one>>
<<fit.save.more>>
print(popmeanbefore)
print(genprevWchange)
}
```

Also must do the computations for the second offspring generation (grown in 2017). 
Unfortunately, the dataset is structured a bit differently, 
and the code below addresses this.

```{r fit.2ndoffspring.cohort, cache=TRUE, cache.extra=key,error=TRUE}
myyearf <- 2017
q <- q16
<<dataf.too>>
subdatfield$grandfather <- subdatfield$paternalID
<<data.too.too>>
<<reshape>>
<<fit>>
<<random.effect.field>>
<<random.effect.field.too>>
<<factory>>
<<mapf>>
<<mapfv>>
<<grandsire.effects>>
<<deltaWtotal>>
<<offspringmeanW.save>>
print(offspringmeanW)
```

What have we got?
```{r show.save.rout}
names(save.rout)


names(save.rout$KW2015)
names(save.rout$KW2016)
names(save.rout$KW2017)

print(save.pedigreedmean$KW2015)
print(save.pedigreedmean$KW2016)
print(save.pedigreedmean$KW2017)

print(save.offspring$KW2016)
print(save.offspring$KW2017)
```
